# Project Title

The lending software that you’ve built so far has been a big success for the company. As part of that success, you’ve been meeting a lot with the Business Operations (BizOps) team to discuss creating additional useful features.

At a recent meeting, a new, high-priority feature request emerged. Specifically, BizOps wants to know if your software can prompt the user to save the qualifying loans as a new CSV file.

This project is a fantastic way to show off your new software engineering skills as you advance in your fintech career.
